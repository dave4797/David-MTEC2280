Final Project Write Up

The project I chose to do is a robot arm that has a scissor attached to it. It utilizes the brightest pixel location function
and the key press function. It started off where the idea was a hair cutting arm. Then, it changed to a paper cutting arm. The
final twist to the project was adding the brightest pixel tracking feature.
