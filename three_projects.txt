Camile Utterback & Romy Achituv - Text Rain

The first project that I would be interested in is the text rain. I felt interested in this project because of 
the way you can move the letters with your hands and different objects. I believe this can be done with a 
projector and some sensors and an ardiuno board. I would also need to code this where the sensors can locate 
the coordinates of the movement of hands and objects. 

Graffiti Research Lab – EyeWriter Draw video graffiti with your eyes

The second project that I would be interested in is the EyeWriter. I feel this is an interesting project because 
it's pretty cool to draw with your eyes and it helps people with disabilites to communicate on a whole 
different level. For this project, I would need a tracker to track the eye's movement and a screen monitor 
for display.

Mine Kafon- Callum Copper

The third project I'm interested in is the landmine clearance. I feel this is an interesting project because it 
helps scout out mines and helps save lives at a very low cost. I would design the product just like the video 
where there is a core like object that has many legs sticking out. Like the video states it will be powered
by wind, but I will add a control function so that it can be control to go a certain place. this can be done
with an ardiuno board.
